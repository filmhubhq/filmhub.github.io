## How It Works

1. [Create a regular account](https://app.filmhub.com/owner/signup).
1. Fill out the [Channel Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13RPrDUBAYiw4vCzVQtjdu3QdO-AhJI0YuBkaMzteGfE/viewform?edit_requested=true#responses).
2. Your dedicated Filmhub account manager will reach out to you and upgrade you to a demo account so you can browse our Catalog.
3. We sign a contract that lets you license available titles in our Catalog.
4. You select titles online, using tools like our [Catalog Browser](http://help.filmhub.com/en/articles/3031183-title-discovery-licensing) and Watchlists.
5. Titles are delivered automatically in 3-5 business days to your [Amazon S3, FTP/SFTP, or Aspera server](http://help.filmhub.com/en/articles/2692190-setting-up-file-transfer)
6. Your customers watch our titles on your streaming service.
7. You report monthly revenue share earnings and remit payment to Filmhub.

At Filmhub, we believe in achieving success *with* our Channels and not at the expense of our Channels, which is why we do not require minimum guarantees for content. Instead, we work solely on a revenue share basis to ensure that the price you pay for content is directly linked to the popularity of that title on your platform and with your customers. No unreasonable expectations, no upfront payments and no gatekeeping.
