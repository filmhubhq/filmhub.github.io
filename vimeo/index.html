        <p class="lead">Exploit content worldwide</p>
        <p>Kinonation is working with Vimeo to enable you to exploit your film/TV/episodic catalog not just in the United States, but also on Vimeo VOD platforms globally. e.g. UK, Germany, Japan. Your content will flow to the Vimeo global platforms you choose, along with the required localization metadata (subtitles, poster art, description, alternate title, etc.) This is a great opportunity to exploit your content globally.</p>
